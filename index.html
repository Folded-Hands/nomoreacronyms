<h1>### no more acronyms ### </h1>
<h2>dont use acronyms, they are confusing</h2>

<p>its better to type the full thing out so people know exactly what youre talking about </p>


<p>if you use an acronym you require the people to already know the context around what youre talking about.
that shuts people out of the discussion immediately and doesnt let new people in </p>


<p>over the internet whats the point of an acronym? 
it doesnt save time it takes more time to understand immediately</p>


<p>and anyway seeing the direct meaning of something is always better than having to make a representation conversion in your brain</p>




<p>lets make the world easier and more friendly to new people at the table</p>
